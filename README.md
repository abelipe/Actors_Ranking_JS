# Actors Ranking JS

This is a web page where actors will be searched and ranked by awards won using an API. The functional part will be programmed exclusively in JavaScript using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Functional Programming (FP) principles. The project will be implemented on a large scale, avoiding the use of traditional control structures like `if`, `else`, and `for`.
